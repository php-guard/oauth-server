 * @see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.4
 * The client credentials (or other forms of client authentication) can
 * be used as an authorization grant when the authorization scope is
 * limited to the protected resources under the control of the client,
 * or to protected resources previously arranged with the authorization
 * server.  Client credentials are used as an authorization grant
 * typically when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is
 * also the resource owner) or is requesting access to protected
 * resources based on an authorization previously arranged with the
 * authorization server.
 *
 * @see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4
 * The client can request an access token using only its client
 * credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
 * client is requesting access to the protected resources under its
 * control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously
 * arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond
 * the scope of this specification).
 *
 * The client credentials grant type MUST only be used by confidential
 * clients.
