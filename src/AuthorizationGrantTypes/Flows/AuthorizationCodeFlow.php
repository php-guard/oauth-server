/**
 * Class AuthorizationCodeFlow
 * @package OAuth2\AuthorizationGrantTypes\Flows
 *
 * @see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1
 * The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server
 * as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.  Instead of
 * requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client
 * directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its
 * user-agent as defined in [RFC2616]), which in turn directs the
 * resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.
 *
 * Before directing the resource owner back to the client with the
 * authorization code, the authorization server authenticates the
 * resource owner and obtains authorization.  Because the resource owner
 * only authenticates with the authorization server, the resource
 * owner's credentials are never shared with the client.
 *
 * The authorization code provides a few important security benefits,
 * such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the
 * transmission of the access token directly to the client without
 * passing it through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially
 * exposing it to others, including the resource owner.
 *
 * @see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1
 * The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
 * tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.
 * Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
 * interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
 * browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
 * from the authorization server.

     * If the resource owner grants the access request, the authorization
     * server issues an authorization code and delivers it to the client by
     * adding the following parameters to the query component of the
     * redirection URI using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format,
     * per Appendix B:
     *
     * code
     * REQUIRED.  The authorization code generated by the
     * authorization server.  The authorization code MUST expire
     * shortly after it is issued to mitigate the risk of leaks.  A
     * maximum authorization code lifetime of 10 minutes is
     * RECOMMENDED.  The client MUST NOT use the authorization code
     * more than once.  If an authorization code is used more than
     * once, the authorization server MUST deny the request and SHOULD
     * revoke (when possible) all tokens previously issued based on
     * that authorization code.  The authorization code is bound to
     * the client identifier and redirection URI.
     *
     * state
     * REQUIRED if the "state" parameter was present in the client
     * authorization request.  The exact value received from the
     * client.
     *
     * For example, the authorization server redirects the user-agent by
     * sending the following HTTP response:
     *
     * HTTP/1.1 302 Found
     * Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
     * &state=xyz
     *
     * The client MUST ignore unrecognized response parameters.  The
     * authorization code string size is left undefined by this
     * specification.  The client should avoid making assumptions about code
     * value sizes.  The authorization server SHOULD document the size of
     * any value it issues.
