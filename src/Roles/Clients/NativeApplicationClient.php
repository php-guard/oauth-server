 * Client Types
 *
 *     A native application is a public client installed and executed on
 * the device used by the resource owner.  Protocol data and
 * credentials are accessible to the resource owner.  It is assumed
 * that any client authentication credentials included in the
 * application can be extracted.  On the other hand, dynamically
 * issued credentials such as access tokens or refresh tokens can
 * receive an acceptable level of protection.  At a minimum, these
 * credentials are protected from hostile servers with which the
 * application may interact.  On some platforms, these credentials
 * might be protected from other applications residing on the same
 * device.
