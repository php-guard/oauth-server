 *
 * @see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2
 * Before initiating the protocol, the client registers with the
 * authorization server.  The means through which the client registers
 * with the authorization server are beyond the scope of this
 * specification but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML
 * registration form.
 *
 * Client registration does not require a direct interaction between the
 * client and the authorization server.  When supported by the
 * authorization server, registration can rely on other means for
 * establishing trust and obtaining the required client properties
 * (e.g., redirection URI, client type).  For example, registration can
 * be accomplished using a self-issued or third-party-issued assertion,
 * or by the authorization server performing client discovery using a
 * trusted channel.
 *
 * When registering a client, the client developer SHALL:
 * o  specify the client type as described in Section 2.1,
 * o  provide its client redirection URIs as described in Section 3.1.2,
 * and
 * o  include any other information required by the authorization server
 * (e.g., application name, website, description, logo image, the
 * acceptance of legal terms).

     *
     * The client identifier string size is left undefined by this
     * specification.  The client should avoid making assumptions about the
     * identifier size.  The authorization server SHOULD document the size
     * of any identifier it issues.
